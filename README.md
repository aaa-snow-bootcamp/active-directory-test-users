# Active Directory Test Users - Lab Guide

## Overview

Requirements:

- Access to Windows with Active Directory

## Groups

Work notes:

- Create groups manually
- Modify below step to include group assignments

## Generating user data

1. We first use https://mockaroo.com/ to generate user data. You can use this [example dataset](https://mockaroo.com/2d94ad00) as a starting point.

2. Make sure to enter the LDAP attribute names in the Field Name column. This way we can import the data later automatically, without having to manually map the fields.

> [Reference of LDAP attribute names](https://www.manageengine.com/products/ad-manager/help/csv-import-management/active-directory-ldap-attributes.html)

3. Choose CSV as the export format.

âœ” Now we have a CSV file with our user data.

## Importing user data into Active Directory

Work notes: 

- Use import script from https://activedirectorypro.com/create-bulk-users-active-directory/
- Modify to read out columns, if possible. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11885246/how-do-i-loop-through-a-line-from-a-csv-file-in-powershell.
